    <h2>Solar Fly</h2>

    <p>Combine a two transistor astable oscilator with solar panels and a joule thief for a cyber fly that blinks when the sun shines.</p>

    <p>Astable oscillator with only 2 NPN transistors, 2 capacitors and 4 resistors. Just steal it from the internet.</p>

    <p>Finding a joule thief to boost the voltage of the solar panels enough to light up the LEDs is easy too. Great example on <a href="http://www.bigclive.com/joule.htm">bigclive.com</a>. Slap it to the oscillator circuit to get this. On the far left are the solar panels feeding the joule thief. Not sure if that's the right symbol.</p>

    <p>Next was planning the layout to make it look like a bug. Again, those aren't LEDs, they're the solar panels.</p>

    <p>The ferrite torus was scavenged from some broken electronics and the wire is from a CAT5 ethernet cable. The resistors are &#8539;W.</p>

    <p>The solar panels are rated for 0.5V. Two output a max of 1V under full sun, usualy less than that. The joule thief boosts it enough to light up the LEDs.</p>
